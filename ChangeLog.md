nothing to major in this update it was largely a refactor of what already existed to make it more fluid and purpouseful.

## **Changed**:
- some CSS around heights of the current random team and the last team have changed to make the page more consistent.
- refactored most of the logic to be more compact and understood.
- tried to change the CSS around other device sizes so little to no visual oddities occur.

Found some not so great renderings when using the site recently and wanted to fix it.

- **Backgrounds** will be a noticebly different in some places to keep the ui from being too samey.
