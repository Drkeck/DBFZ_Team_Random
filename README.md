# DBFZ_Team_Random
Built this for my free time, me and a good friend of mine like to roll random teams in Dragonball FighterZ since we have been playing the game against each other for just over 2 years now.

# built with:
  * Javascript
  * CSS3
  * HTML5
  * love and elbow grease

## Extra:
i don't know why buy i am strangely proud of the little work i did on this, since its a little nieche and not a lot of honest work it was just the sheer fact that i came up with an idea of it while trying to do random teams against a freind of mine, and that alond drove me far enough to be able to build this out, host it oh GH, and make sure it was working more that just nth % amount of times.
